This mod adds two reactors to generate heat. You can use heat generators to convert energy.
Heater:
Uranium reactor: uranium is used as fuel for reator,it's a Controlled nuclear fission reactor
Hydrogen reactor: hydrogen is used as fuel for reator,It's a Controllable hydrogen fusion reactor.
Thermal power building:
Thermal power generator (all): Runing by high temperature to make dynamo run.

Sorry Machine Translation.      : (
